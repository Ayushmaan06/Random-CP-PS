    1. Think Greedy
    2. Think Brute Force
    3. Think solution in reverse order
    4. Think DP [ check constraints carefully ]
    5. Check base cases for DP and prove solution for Greedy
    6. Think Graph 
    7. ceil a/b=(a+b-1)/b do remember
    8. Take care while converting double/float to integers!!! Add some small double number before conversion!!
    throws precision errors!

    9. Remember to convert size() to int!! Causes creji errors!
    10. XOR is invertible to itself.
    11.If x = a mod b then a mod 2b = x or x+a
    12. (a+b)modc = (a+b-c)modc
